Group 1
Project Name: Plan_r
Members: Mabel Sperry, Dwight Coles III, Jose Acosta

The goal was to create a website that allows the user to plan thoughts, tasks, and events to serve as a flexible, everyday life organization tool.

To test the site, run XAMPP and make sure all servers are functioning properly.

Then, load the site files into the htdocs folder under a directory called plan_r and go to localhost/plan_r/login.html.

Site has been tested on Chrome and Firefox, the jQuery libary is used.

All of the code was written by Mabel except for some of the style code, which was done by Dwight.
He added the modal for the login and create account pages, which the starter code was taken from w3schools.
